> :warning: While I try to be as active as I can be, it may take me some time to resolve issues as I am much busier these days than when I started this project. I appreciate ALL contributions and will try my best to respond as soon as I am able to. Thank you for understanding :) - @joestandring
## Installation
1. Clone and enter the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/joestandring/dwm-bar
cd dwm-bar
```
2. (Optional) Install Dependencies from ```dep/YourDisto.txt```. This will install dependencies for ALL functions so consider excluding ones you do not plan to use. These can be found at the top of each bar function.
```
sudo xbps-install -S $(cat dep/void.txt) # Void
sudo pacman -S $(cat dep/arch.txt)       # Arch
sudo dnf install $(cat dep/fedora.txt)   # Fedora
```
> :warning: There are no dnf packages for [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd), [pamixer](https://github.com/cdemoulins/pamixer) and [cmus](https://github.com/cmus/cmus). If you want to utilise these packages, please install them manually as shown in the corresponding gihub repos.
3. (Optional) If you plan to use unicode identifiers, you should install a font which includes these ([Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), [siji](https://github.com/stark/siji))
4. Enable/disable desired functions (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
5. Run the script
```
./dwm_bar.sh
```

## Configuration
dwm-bar will require some setup before it can be used.
### Enabling Functions
Functions can be enabled by adding them to the import and upperbar variable in dwm_bar.sh. By default, all available functions will be commented here. If you are using the [extrabar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/extrabar/) patch, functions can also be added to lowerbar to appear on the bottom of the screen. Some more intensive functions are parallelized to prevent the bar freezing. These are imported the same as regular functions but added to the ```parallelize()``` function first. These use different names to regular functions and are commented out by default in dwm_bar.sh.

To enable dwm_battery and dwm_backlight on the top bar and dwm_pulse and dwm_weather (parallelized) on the bottom bar, for example, you should use:
```
# Import the modules
. "$DIR/bar-functions/dwm_battery.sh"
. "$DIR/bar-functions/dwm_backlight.sh"
. "$DIR/bar-functions/dwm_pulse.sh"
. "$DIR/bar-functions/dwm_weather.sh"

parallelize() {
    while true
    do
        printf "Running parallel processes\n"
        dwm_weather &
        sleep 5
    done
}
parallelize &

# Update dwm status bar every second
while true
do
    # Append results of each func one by one to the upperbar string
    upperbar=""
    upperbar="$upperbar$(dwm_battery)"
    upperbar="$upperbar$(dwm_backlight)"
   
    # Append results of each func one by one to the lowerbar string
    lowerbar=""
    lowerbar="$lowerbar$(dwm_pulse)"
    lowerbar="$lowerbar$(__DWM_BAR_WEATHER__)"
    
    #xsetroot -name "$upperbar"
    
    # Uncomment the line below to enable the lowerbar 
    xsetroot -name "$upperbar;$lowerbar"
    sleep 1
done
```
### Refresh rate
If updating the bar every second is an issue, you can change the ```sleep``` amount of both regular and parallelized functions in dwm_bar.sh.
### Configuring functions
Some functions, such as dwm_weather require additional setup and will be outlined with a comment where this is the case.
### Identifiers
Unicode or plaintext identifiers can be used by altering the ```$IDENTIFIER``` value in dwm_bar.sh. For example, when set to ```"unicode"```, dwm_mail will display:
```
[üì´ 0]
```
Otherwise, when not set it will display:
```
[MAIL 0]
```
